<!--Setup
    Components (Nodes,Connectors) XML files -> Edit, Update, Delete, Add
    Runtime -> Consuming this properties in doing the job generating the drawing
    IAN => for now hard coded components limiting user to only those 
          1. Save tech properties in xml together with drawing props
          2. 3 example components for air thermo dynamics (pipe, Fan, Ventilator)
              - Drawing this custom components
              - User defining all properties
              - for connectors defining inputs from outputs and both
              
    Connection Rules  => Definition limits and possibilities [Future]
